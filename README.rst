=====================
Tablet swivel support
=====================

This project contains the necessary files for supporting Lenovo X200t tablet rotation on Linux, at 
least under Ubuntu Maverick.  To install, simply run ``setup.sh``, add ``tabletswivel_listener.py`` 
to your "Startup applications" and reboot.

Please fork this and add more features and support for other tablets.
